    You’re in the business of making people happy. Whether that comes as a delicious meal, the ideal hotel stay, or a party like it’s 1999, good times are your M.O. 
    
    But if you’re not sure how to sell those good times, I’m here to help.  
    
    I’m Kate McDermott, and Eat, Drink, and Write Copy is how I help busy hospitality pros get more website visitors and increased sales in a super competitive market.
    
    You bring the celebration; I bring the communication. 
    
    (But you should bring the cocktails.)
